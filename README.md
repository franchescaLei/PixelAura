# PixelAura

This is the final project for my Mobile Systems and Development class.

PixelAura is kind of like a ‚Äúwe have Twitter at home‚Äù type of thing. It‚Äôs a simple platform mainly for artists who want to share their work or collaborate. It supports multiple users at once and lets people post their own art, like and repost others, and even allow free downloads. There‚Äôs a basic notification system, messaging, following, and customizable profiles. It‚Äôs not super advanced yet, but it covers all the essentials.

It uses Firebase Auth for login and signup (with password reset via email), Firestore for database stuff, and Imgur for image uploads. Make sure to use a valid email when registering so you can actually reset your password if needed. Just note it runs on free Firebase limits, so things like read/write operations and signups are capped under that threshold.

**NOTE: It is suggested to use the app while your app's theme is light mode because i didnt have time to fix how it looks when its on dark mode. Basically, please use light mode on your device while using the app to fully enjoy the design and color scheme**
